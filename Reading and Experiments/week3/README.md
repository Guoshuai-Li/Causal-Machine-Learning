# Week 3: Multivariate Intervention and Adjustment Methods

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates multivariate causal inference techniques, focusing on intervention operations, backdoor adjustment, and confounding control in complex DAG structures.

## Learning Objectives
- Build and analyze multivariate DAGs with complex confounding structures
- Compare intervention P(Y|do(X)) vs conditioning P(Y|X) effects
- Implement backdoor criterion for adjustment set identification
- Evaluate multiple adjustment methods for causal effect estimation

## Experimental Setup

### DAG Structure
```
Z1 → Z2 → X → Y (confounding chain)
Z1 → X (direct confounding)
Z2 → Y (direct confounding)  
Z3 → Y (independent cause)
X → M → Y (mediation pathway)
```

### Key Questions
1. **Intervention vs Conditioning**: Do P(Y|X) and P(Y|do(X)) differ at non-source nodes?
2. **Source Node Equivalence**: Are interventions equivalent to conditioning at source nodes?
3. **Multipoint Effects**: How do joint interventions compare to single interventions?
4. **Adjustment Methods**: Which backdoor adjustment sets provide unbiased estimates?

## Results Summary

### Intervention vs Conditioning Comparison
- **Non-source node (X)**: Clear differences between P(Y|X) and P(Y|do(X))
  - P(Y|X): [-1.434, 0.003, 1.523]
  - P(Y|do(X)): [-1.167, 0.014, 1.149]
- **Source node (Z1)**: Close equivalence between conditioning and intervention
  - P(Y|Z1): [-1.374, -0.021, 1.433]
  - P(Y|do(Z1)): [-1.750, -0.000, 1.729]

### Multipoint Intervention Analysis
- **Single interventions**: do(X=1) = 1.160, do(Z2=1) = 1.440
- **Joint intervention**: do(X=1,Z2=1) = 1.760
- **Non-additive effects**: Joint effect < sum of individual effects (1.760 < 2.575)

### Backdoor Adjustment Performance
- **Unadjusted estimate**: 1.423 (42.3% bias)
- **Ground truth effect**: 1.000
- **Valid adjustment sets**: 5 sets identified automatically
- **Adjustment results**: Set_1 = 1.169, Set_2 = 1.431 (significant improvement)

### Method Comparison Results
- **Correct adjustment**: 1.158 (close to ground truth)
- **Collider bias**: 1.024 (demonstrates conditioning on descendants)
- **Stratified analysis**: 1.261 (better than overall 1.423)
- **IPW method**: 1.382 vs simple ATE 1.905 (27% improvement)

## Key Findings
1. **Mechanism invariance confirmed**: Interventions break incoming edges while preserving structural equations
2. **Backdoor adjustment works**: Multiple valid adjustment sets successfully remove confounding bias
3. **Collider conditioning harmful**: Including descendants in adjustment creates bias
4. **Propensity methods effective**: IPW provides substantial bias reduction over simple comparisons
