## Question: Why is the empty set S mentioned? And what is the meaning of "invariance" in the context of "empty set"?

**Answer:** 
- When $S = \emptyset$, it means we have not released any cause to change.
- If $Y$'s distribution has already changed under different experimental conditions, then we obviously cannot say that $Y$'s distribution is "invariant".
- Therefore, we will conclude that "the empty set is not invariant".
- At this point, we need to find some $X_s$ (i.e., add and test variables) to see if we can solve this environmental change problem.
- Once we find an $S$ such that the distribution of $Y|X_S$ is invariant across environments, we can recognize this $S$ as a causal structure.

In summary, rejecting the invariance assumption for the empty set $S = \emptyset$ means that $Y$ has inconsistent marginal distributions across different environments. Since $S = \emptyset$ represents "not releasing any cause", this invariance rejection requires that $Y$ itself has different distributions across all environments.
