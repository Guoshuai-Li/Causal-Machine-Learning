## Question: Why is the empty set S mentioned? What does "invariance assumption" mean, and what is the meaning of "invariance" in the context of "empty set"?

**Answer:** 

Rejecting the invariance assumption for the empty set $S = \emptyset$ means that $Y$ has inconsistent marginal distributions across different environments. However, $S = \emptyset$ means "there is no release of any cause", so the invariance rejection here requires that $Y$ itself has different distributions across environments.
