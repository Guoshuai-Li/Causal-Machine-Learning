# Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP)

- **Problem:** Models often fail under distribution shifts or interventions; correlations learned from one environment may break in another.

- **Goal:** Identify variables whose relationship with the target *remains invariant* across multiple environments.

- **Key Assumption:** The conditional distribution $P(Y \mid X_{S^\*})$ *stays the same under all environments if* $S^\*$ contains the true causal parents of $Y$.

- **Approach:** Test each candidate set $S \subseteq \{X_1, \ldots, X_p\}$ for invariance of $P(Y \mid X_S)$ across environments, and take the intersection of accepted sets.

- **Outcome:** A statistically valid subset $\hat{S} \subseteq S^\*$ of direct causal predictors and confidence intervals for their effects.

- **Intuition:** Causal mechanisms are stable â€” exploiting this stability turns causality into a testable statistical property.
